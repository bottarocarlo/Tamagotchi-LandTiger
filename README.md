# LandTiger V2.0 LPC1768 Development Board - Tamagotchi
## Getting Started
Tamagotchi is a famous toy from the end of the ’90s and the beginning of the new millennium (but they still make them with genetics, NFC, and Bluetooth!). The goal of the game was to take care of a virtual pet, taking care of its basic needs, such as hunger and happiness. Of course, in the end, many kids just had tons of them on their consciences.

The project has been developed using ARM KEIL µVision5, a powerful IDE with built in functions and a large support for multiple devices on the LandTiger (LPC1768 ARM Development Board) for the Computer Architecture course @ PoliTo.
